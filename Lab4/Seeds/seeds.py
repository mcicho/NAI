Before use: pip install numpy , pip install pandas , pip install sklearn
The goal of this program is to teach the dataset to predict accuracy of three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian.
Inputs are features of kernel of seed. 
Outputs are three different varieties of wheat.
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds
Based on tutorial from website https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/ and code from NAI lecture.
