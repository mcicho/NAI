Before use: pip install numpy, pip install sklearn
The goal of this program is to teach the dataset to recognize and predict accuracy of letters based on their sizes, edges and etc.
Dataset: https://www.openml.org/d/6 , https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition
Based on tutorial from websites https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neural_networks/plot_mnist_filters.html , 
http://athena.ecs.csus.edu/ and code from NAI lecture.
